How it works
-------

There are just one buyer and one seller, interacting with chia smart coins, no arbitrage or middle-man involved.

Buyer will deposit 125% of price into a smart coin of his control, for a specific seller, and a payment file will be created to locate that coin. That could be recover by buyer at any time while seller has not locked that payment yet.

Seller has power enough to lock buyerâ€™s amount if he is willing to deposit on top 30% of price.
Seller could decide to cancel after locked, buyer will have back 130% of the price. and seller 25% or price.

Once Seller has locked the amount, trade off-chain can begin by seller. And trade will not be over until buyer confirm received. Once confirmed by buyer, seller will received his 30% deposit plus 100% payment, and buyer will have back his 25% deposit.
